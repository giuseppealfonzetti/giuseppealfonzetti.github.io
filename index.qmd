## About me
Hi there! My name is Giuseppe, and I am a postdoctoral Research Assistant in Statistics at the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it/it/ateneo-uniud/ateneo-uniud-organizzazione/dipartimenti/dies). 

I'm particularly interested in computational methods for estimating latent variable models with applications in psychometrics and social sciences.
My current research focuses on combining stochastic approximations with composite likelihoods to scale the estimation of such models to high-dimensional settings.

I pursued my PhD at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/) of the University of Padova, with the thesis "Stochastic estimation methods for latent variable models". In 2022, I visited [the Psychometric Research Group](https://psychometricslab.com/) at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics), where I started working on computational methods for psychometrics applications.
