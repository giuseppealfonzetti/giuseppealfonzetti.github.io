## About me
Hi there! My name is Giuseppe, and I am a PhD student at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/) of the University of Padova.

I'm particularly interested in computational methods for the estimation of latent variable models, with applications in psychometrics and social sciences.
My current research focuses on combining stochastic approximations with composite likelihoods to scale the estimation of such models to high-dimensional settings.

During my PhD, I visited [the Psychometric Research Group](https://psychometricslab.com/) at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics), where I met some great people and started working on computational methods for psychometrics applications.
