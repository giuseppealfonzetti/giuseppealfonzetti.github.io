    "text": "Hi there! My name is Giuseppe, and I am a PhD student at the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova.\nIâ€™m particularly interested in computational methods for the estimation of latent variable models, with applications in psychometrics and social sciences. My current research focuses on combining stochastic approximations with composite likelihoods to scale the estimation of such models to high-dimensional settings.\nDuring my PhD, I visited the Psychometric Research Group at the London School of Economics, where I met some great people and started working on computational methods for psychometrics applications."
